## Working with Branches

The [MS Collaborate GitHub repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/MicrosoftCollaboratePortal) utilizes two main parent branches: [Master](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/MicrosoftCollaboratePortal/tree/master), this content can be reviewed on the [staging site](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/collaborate), and [Live](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/MicrosoftCollaboratePortal/tree/live), for content appearing on the [live site](https://docs.microsoft.com/collaborate). 

When making contributions, please submit your Pull Request (PR) to the **Master** branch. This branch can be viewed on the staging site and should only contain contributions that are ready to be published live. You may also create and submit a branch with your own unique branch name which can be selected and viewed in the staging site. (The **Live** branch is only allowed for use by the content administrators.)
