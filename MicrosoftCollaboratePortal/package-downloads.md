# Working with Packages to Download Content

In Microsoft Collaborate (MS Collaborate), downloadable content is available as *Packages* that contain the files to download.  Packages have metadata associated with them to facilitate finding the right packages, such as a description, package type, publish date,  and keywords.   

Which packages you can download depends on the engagements you belong to.  During publishing, Content Publishers target specific engagements for the package. If you are a participant member of an engagement, you will be able to see the packages for that engagement.  This means users can only see packages associated with engagements they belong to.

MS Collaborate provides two mechanisms for downloading content packages:
1. MS Collaborate **Packages page on the portal** enables you to find packages and download individual files from a package. 
2. MS Collaborate **Distribution Manager** can be installed on your local machine to download multiple files and packages at once.

Regardless of the download mechanism used, users will see the same packages in the portal as in the Distribution Manager.

Content Publisher is a permissions role in MS Collaborate associated with engagements.  At this time, only Microsoft users can publish to engagements. Engagement Owners define which users have Content Publisher permissions.

## Finding Packages in the MS Collaborate portal

On the **Packages** page, you can filter and search for packages based on multiple criteria, including:
- words in the name, 
- the Program or Engagement that the package belongs to, 
- when the package was published, 
- the type of files in the package, and
- by using keywords.

For example, if you are looking for a specific Windows Build package and you know the build number, you could enter it as a filter. Each filter box is cumulative, so you can start with fewer filters and add more to limit the number of packages returned until you find what you are looking for. You can also sort the list of packages by column to help with locating packages.

The Distribution Manager has basic search/sort capabilities, but the portal provides a richer search/filter experience.  If you have many packages available to you, it is recommended that you use the portal's search to find the right package, and then search on the package name in the Distribution Manager.

## How to download files from the MS Collaborate portal

1. From the Dashboard, click on "Packages" to get to the **Packages** page, where you will see a list of all packages available to download.

2. Search or use **Advanced Filters** to find the package you would like to download. The filters are cumulative to help narrow the search. Use the "Clear Filters" button to remove all filters.
	- Click the **Advanced Filters** icon to toggle display of the Advanced Filter" fields.

4. Click on each file to initiate the download. In the MS Collaborate portal you can download one file at a time. 

## Using Distribution Manager for multi-file downloads

If you want to download a whole packages with multiple files or large packages, we recommend installing the **Distribution Manager**.  The Distribution Manager is a ClickOnce client application that will update as required.  

This client application connects to MS Collaborate services using the same credentials you use to log in to the MS Collaborate portal. All of the same packages you can see on the MS Collaborate portal will appear in the Distribution Manager.

In addition to downloading multiple files at once, you can queue many packages to run in the background and you can also customize download settings to address connection issues.

### How to install the Distribution Manager

From the **Packages** page, click the **Download Distribution Manager** button at the top of the page.

Distribution Manager uses the same account you use for MS Collaborate.  If you launch it from the MS Collaborfate portal, you will be logged in automatically.
