Updated: *April 2020*

## 1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS OF USE
Microsoft provides you with access to a variety of resources on this web site, comprised of documents, images, videos and other content ("Content"); software such as pre-release software, developer tools, computer code, and sample code ("Software"); and communication forums and other services ("Services"). For clarity, Software does not include any Content.  The Content, Software, Services and all other aspects of this web site are subject to these Terms of Use (“terms”). Microsoft reserves the right to update these terms at any time without notice to you. The applicable and most current version of the terms can be reviewed by clicking on the "Terms of Use" hypertext link located at the bottom of our web pages.

By accessing or using this web site in any way, you agree to and are bound by the terms. If you are agreeing to these terms on behalf on an entity, such as your employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity.  If you specify a company in connection with accessing this website and agreeing to the terms, you will be deemed to agree to these terms on behalf of that organization or company.  If you do not agree to all of the terms contained herein, do not access or use this web site.

## 2. PRIVACY 
Your privacy is important to us. By using the Software, Service and Content, you agree that Microsoft may collect, use, and disclose the information as described in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://aka.ms/privacy), and as may be described in the user interface associated with the Software or on the web site.  

## 3. SOFTWARE
All Software that is made available from the web site is the copyrighted work of Microsoft or its suppliers and is licensed, not sold.  Your use of Software is governed by the license terms, if any, which accompany or are included with the Software.  If no Microsoft license is presented to you for Software, these terms apply.  The Software or Services may include third-party code. Any third-party scripts or code, linked to or referenced from the software or website, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such code, not by Microsoft. Notices, if any, for the third-party code are included for your information only.

**Pre-Release Software:**  If this web site provides any preview, insider, beta or other pre-release Software (“Pre-release Software”) and does not include a Microsoft license agreement, subject to the terms of this agreement you may use the Pre-release Software on your premises solely to design, develop, and test your programs for use with the Pre-release Software.  You may not test the Pre-release Software in a live operating environment unless Microsoft permits you to do so under another agreement. You may not disclose the results of any benchmark tests of the Pre-release Software to any third party without Microsoft’s prior written approval.  Pre-release Software may not work the way a final version of it will.  Pre-release Software may be substantially different from the commercially released version.  Microsoft also may not release a commercial version.

**Sample Software:**  If this web site provides any Software marked as "sample" or “example” (“Sample Software”) and does not include a Microsoft license agreement, then it is licensed to you under the terms of the MIT license set forth below in Section 19.

**Other Software Without Separate Terms:**  If this web site provides any Software other than Pre-release Software and Sample Software and does not include a Microsoft license agreement, subject to the terms of this agreement you may use it solely to design, develop and test your programs to run on Microsoft products and services. 

## 4. CONTENT
All Content is the copyrighted work of Microsoft or its suppliers. Your use of the Content is governed by license terms, if any, which accompany or are included with the Content.

If any Content is made available to you on this web site without a license agreement, then subject to the terms of this agreement you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Content for your internal use, solely for the purposes of our business relationship with each other. You must preserve the copyright notice set forth below in all copies of the Content and ensure that both the copyright notice and this permission notice appear in those copies.

Microsoft may have patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights covering subject matter in the Content, Software or Services.

## 6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, DATA, AND PERSONAL INFORMATION
Certain portions of this web site are accessible only to users who are invited to participate, for example as part of a program for using Pre-release Software and providing feedback to Microsoft.  All information available in those portions of this web site or concerning Content or Software available in those portions of this web site are confidential information of Microsoft. In addition, all information concerning the Software, Content, or otherwise provided through this web site is confidential information of Microsoft, or its suppliers, if it is designated as “confidential”, “proprietary” or “secret” or similar legend or information that a reasonable person knows or reasonably should understand to be confidential.  

If you have a non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”) with Microsoft, then the terms of that NDA govern your confidentiality obligations with respect to confidential information. If no NDA exists between you and Microsoft, you agree that for a period of five years from the time you accessed this confidential information, you may not disclose this confidential information to any third party. This restriction will not apply to any information that is or becomes publicly available without a breach of this restriction, was lawfully known to the receiver of the information without an obligation to keep it confidential, is received from another source who can disclose it lawfully and without an obligation to keep it confidential, or is independently developed. You may disclose this confidential information if required to comply with a court order or other government demand that has the force of law. Before doing so, you must seek the highest level of protection available and, when possible, give Microsoft enough prior notice to provide a reasonable chance to seek a protective order.

As part of the Content or Services, Microsoft may, at its discretion, provide you with error reporting or other data (“Data”). If you have an applicable agreement with Microsoft that governs sharing of Data and Personal Information (“Data Terms”), then the Data Terms govern your obligations with respect to such exchange.  If no Data Terms exist between you and Microsoft, then:
*	You agree to use Data solely for the purpose of testing and resolving compatibility or quality issues related to how your product works with Microsoft products or services, and not to disclose Data for any purpose; 
*	If Microsoft exposes you to any Personal Information, then between you and Microsoft, that Personal Information is confidential information of Microsoft;
*	If the Data provided to you includes any Personal Information, you agree to delete such Personal Information within thirty (30) days after receipt, and to return to Microsoft or destroy that information immediately upon Microsoft’s request;  
*	During such thirty (30) days, you must store any Personal Information only on a secure server with access to such server limited to you, or if an entity, your regular employees. In addition, you must take any action reasonably requested by Microsoft related to this Data if necessary for Microsoft to comply with its legal obligations;  
*	If you are served with a court order compelling disclosure of any Personal Information, you will oppose the order, will notify Microsoft of such order, and will provide Microsoft the opportunity to intervene before you file any response to the order; and 
*	You agree to conduct an audit on at least an annual basis to verify your compliance with the terms of this section.

In addition, you may not provide Personal Information to Microsoft through the Services other than, at your discretion, business contact information, unless Microsoft permits you to do so under the Data Terms or another agreement. As used herein, “Personal Information" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
